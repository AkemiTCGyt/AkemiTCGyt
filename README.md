👋 Hi, I’m Thomas Le a back-end software developer working on becoming full-stack. I currently have a Bachelors in Operations and Information Management with a
minor in Information Technology.

👀 I’m interested in learning more coding languages and programs because it keeps my mind busy and satiated!

🌱 I’m currently learning Java, SQL, and Spring Boot in the Promineo Tech coding bootcamp back-end program.

💞️ I’m looking to find the best apprenticeship to learn and utilize as much of my coding skills as possible.
